CaleProcure Events Scraper
This repository contains a Selenium-based scraper for extracting detailed bid opportunity information from the California State procurement portal (CaleProcure).

Features
•	Navigates the CaleProcure event search page and iterates through event rows.
•	Opens each event’s detail page in a separate tab and extracts structured data.
•	Captures core fields: Event Name, Event ID, Dept, Format/Type, Event Version, Published Date, Event End Date.
•	Extracts Contact Information, Pre-Bid Conference details, Description text, and UNSPSC codes.
•	Follows the "View Event Package" link and collects attachment download URLs from the "Download Attachment" popup.
•	Handles common UI issues: loading screen, blocked popup notices, stale elements, and other intermittent Selenium errors.
•	Supports partial/segmented scraping using a row range argument so large runs can be split across multiple executions.
•	Writes results as a structured JSON file.

Command-Line Usage

    python Caleprocure_events_scraper.py --out-json caleprocure_all.json
